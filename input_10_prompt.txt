Here is the enhanced prompt for optimizing the provided Python program:

<prompt>
Please modify the Python program enclosed in the <program></program> tags to add the following functionality between the steps of prompt enhancement and querying the Anthropic API with the enhanced prompt:

1. Print the enhanced prompt to the console so the user can review it 
2. Prompt the user with a menu of options:
   a. Continue with querying the Anthropic API using the enhanced prompt
   b. Retry enhancing the original prompt (go back to the prompt enhancement step)
   c. Abort execution of the program altogether
3. Based on the user's input, take the appropriate action:
   - If they choose to continue, proceed with querying the Anthropic API as in the original program
   - If they choose to retry enhancement, go back to the prompt enhancement step with the original prompt
   - If they choose to abort, exit the program gracefully

<examples>
Enhanced prompt:
"""
Here is the enhanced version of your original prompt... 
"""

Please choose an option:
1. Continue with Anthropic API query
2. Retry enhancing original prompt
3. Abort program

Enter your choice (1, 2, or 3): 
</examples>

Please only modify the parts of the program necessary to add this new functionality. Preserve the original prompt enhancement and Anthropic API querying logic. The modified program should be enclosed in <program></program> tags.
</prompt>

<explanation>
The key changes made to enhance the original prompt:

1. Broke down the desired modifications into clear, step-by-step instructions for updating the program logic
2. Provided an example of the new user interaction flow, including the enhanced prompt printout and user menu
3. Clarified that only the necessary parts of the program should be modified, preserving core functionality
4. Specified that the modified program code should be enclosed in <program></program> tags

These enhancements aim to provide clearer guidance to the model on how to update the program to add the requested functionality, while ensuring the original prompt enhancement and API query logic remain intact. The example demonstrates the desired UX flow without providing an actual enhanced prompt or suggesting specific code changes.
</explanation>

In summary, I enhanced the prompt to provide step-by-step instructions and an illustrative example to guide the model in modifying the program as requested, while constraining it to only make necessary changes and preserve existing functionality. Let me know if you would like me to further optimize the prompt!
